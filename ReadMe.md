This is my Assignment 2 which includes a Mortgage Payment Schedule & a CPI  Project. 

The Mortgage Payment Schedule when used, provides a excel sheet & a graph. It uses Matplotlib, Pandas & Numpy to generate results. It provides results by using quoted interests rate (semi-annual compounding), amortization period, principal amount & years (terms). 

The CPI Project provides results that are generated by processing & manipulating the data present in the files that were provided on Canvas. It will answer all the questions as asked in the assignment guidelines. 

Overall, this project was very helpful regarding learning new tools, new mothods and finding innovative solutions to solve problems.
